Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically  manipulating bits or other pieces oof data shorter than a byte.
Bit manipulation involves the manipulation of individual bits in a binary representation of data.
In this project, i will take care of the following:
* Converts a binary to an unsigned int.
* Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number
* Find ppassword etc.
